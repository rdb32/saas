            <div><article><h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3><p>Maven Pro is a modern sans serif typeface. Like Nunito, Maven Pro features a wide, boxy letter width. Its unique curvature and letterforms make it very distinguishable and legible in longer form content. Its flat terminals provide contrast from the rounded Nunito.</p></article></div>

            <div><article><h3>CSS Properties</h3><p>It’s time we started to draw inspiration from fields or areas that go beyond digital design. Print and editorial designs can be beautiful, so why not break old habits and try new CSS properties that open a whole new world of endless possibilities?</p></article>

            <div><article><h3>Questions to Ask</h3><p>We have all been in the awkward situation of meeting someone new and having to build rapport quickly — at networking events, industry conferences, charity events, dinner parties, and other social-professional situations. If you’re like many people — especially most Americans — you break the awkward silence with a pretty standard question:</p></article>

            <div><article><h3>How to Vector Hair</h3><p>Vectoring hair on portraits can be a time-consuming process and is sometimes difficult to master in a short space of time. A few years back, I wanted to help solve this issue by creating a set of brushes in Adobe Illustrator.</p></article></div>
        
            <div><article><h3>Master the perspective grid tool</h3><p>The perspective tool, much like anything in Adobe Illustrator, can seem a little complicated and daunting at first.

            <div><article><h3>Why Read It Later?</h3><p>I started buying my first PDAs and smartphones back in the early 2000s, and I immediately began trying to hack together a way to read long-form articles on these mobile devices. I would actually copy and paste articles from the internet into text documents, and then use various apps to read those text documents.</p></article></div>
        
            <div><article><h3>The Psychological Trap of Freelancing</h3><p>The upside of becoming aware of the time/money connection is that I got better at managing my finances and asking for bigger fees — a good thing, especially when compared to how lackadaisical I’d been in this department previously. But I was also stressed out. I started sleeping less, and I stopped hanging out with my friends as much as I wanted. And I would sometimes fall apart completely, frittering away a Saturday in bed and feeling horrible about it.</p></article></div>
